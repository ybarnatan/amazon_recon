The objective is to analyze invoice discrepancies and **identify shipment shortages** reported by Amazon for its suppliers — with the ultimate goal of **recovering unpaid amounts** and proving that all ordered units were shipped. The analysis reflects real-world tasks performed by supplier-side data teams working with Amazon.
